# NumptyPhysics Vita
Numpty Physics port for PSVITA.

Vita Port of NumptyPhysics for PSP.
This port is an improved version of the [first Vita port made by meetpatty](https://github.com/meetpatty/numpty-physics-for-vita).<br>
I decided to make a brand new repository cause meetpatty seems to be unreachable even via mail.<br><br>

I'm planning to add some other new feature differently to meetpatty port such as BGM audio playback, touch support, retrotouch support.<br>
As of now, this is a 1:1 adaptation of meetpatty code for HENkaku with some bugfixes.<br><br>
